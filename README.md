# KRON

A distributed cron system, based on Kafka for processing scheduled tasks as specified in a crontab across multiple nodes.

Native cron systems process tasks on a single node, creating a single point of failure. Kron improves this by scheduling tasks on producer node(s) and distributing to consumer nodes using Kafka.
